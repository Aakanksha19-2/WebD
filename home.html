         There are about 320,000 known species of plants, of which the great majority, some 260â€“290 thousand, produce seeds.<b style="color: rgb(54, 41, 196); background-color: goldenrod;"> Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen, and are the basis of most of Earth's ecosystems.</b> Plants that produce grain, fruit, and vegetables also form basic human foods and have been domesticated for millennia. Plants have many cultural and other uses, as ornaments, building materials, writing material and, in great variety, they have been the source of medicines and psychoactive drugs. The scientific study of plants is known as botany, a branch of biology.

                Starting a garden is just like real estate it's all about location. Place your garden in a part of your yard where you'll see it regularly (out of sight, out of mind definitely applies to gardening). That way, you'll be much more likely to spend time in it. In <b style="color: orange ;">organic gardening</b>, the process begins and ends with the soil. Instead of relying on synthetic fertilizers to provide nutrient releases for crops, organic gardeners continually work to build the fertility of the soil through additions of organic matter. Making compost out of vegetable scraps, crop residue, weeds, manure and other sources ensures the formation of humus, <b style="color: rgb(127, 189, 247) ;">a long-term builder of soil fertility</b>, much better than just tilling these things directly into the soil.

            <h2>Species</h2>
            <p>
                Plants evolved from aquatic ancestors and have subsequently migrated over the entire surface of Earth, inhabiting tropical, Arctic, desert, and Alpine regions. Some plants have returned to an aquatic habitat in either fresh or salt water.<b style="color: rgb(7, 178, 73);">Nature has endowed India with a rich biological diversity, which includes over 40,000 species of plants and 75000 species of animals.</b> India has about 12% of the global plant wealth amongst which there are nearly 3,000 tree species. There are around 15,000 flowering plant species in India. The main plant species are categorized as :
                <ul>
                    <li>Angiosperms</li>
                    <li>Gymnosperms</li>
